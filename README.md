The virtual mouse operates using hand gestures and motions, captured in real-time by a camera. These gestures are processed and interpreted into cursor movements and actions, such as clicking or scrolling. By combining image processing, computer vision techniques, and machine learning models, the system can track hand landmarks and translate them into meaningful input for the computer.
